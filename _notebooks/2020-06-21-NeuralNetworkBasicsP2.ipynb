    "\n",
    "+ The Loss is not the same as the metric (Accuracy).  Loss is what the models use, Accuracy is more meaningful to us humans.\n",
    "+ We see that our loss slowly decreases each epoch.  Our accuracy is getting better over time as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start at about 10% accuracy, which makes sense.  With random weights we predict correctly 1/10 times.  With 10 digits that sounds like a random guess.  Over time, we slowly decrease the loss and after 30 epochs we are around 36% accuracy.  Much better!  We could keep training more to keep improving accuracy, but I think we see the idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "### This Model vs SOTA\n",
    "\n",
    "What is different about this model than a best practice model?\n",
    "+ This model is only 1 layer.  State of the art for image recognitions will use more layers.  Resnet 34 and Resnet 50 are common (34 and 50 layers).  This would just mean we would alternate between the ReLu and linear layers and duplicate what we are doing with more weights and biases.\n",
    "+ More weights and Biases.  The Weights and Biases I used are fairly small - I ran this extremely quickly on a CPU.  With the appropriate size weight and biases tensors, it would make way more sense to use a GPU.\n",
    "+ Matrix Multiplication is replaced with Convolutions for image recognition.  A Convolution can be thought of as matrix multiplication if you averaged some of the pixels together.  This intuitively makes sense as 1 pixel in itself is meaningless without the context of other pixels.  So we tie them together some.\n",
    "+ Dropout would make our model less likely to overfit and less dependent on specific pixels.  It would do this by randomly ignoring different pixels so it cannot rely on them.  It's very similar to how decision trees randomly ignore variables for their splits.\n",
    "+ Discriminate learning rates means that the learning rates are not the same for all levels of the neural network.  With only 1 layer, naturally we don't worry about this.\n",
    "+ Gradient Descent - we can adjust our learning rate based on our loss to speed up the process\n",
    "+ Transfer learning - we can optimize our weights on a similar task so when we start trying to optimize weights on digits we aren't starting from random variables.  \n",
    "+ Keep training for as many epochs as we see our validation loss decrease\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, these are not completely different models.  These are small tweaks to what we have done above that make improvements - the combination of these small tweaks and a few other tricks are what elevate these models.  There are many 'advanced' variations of Neural Networks, but the concepts are typically along the lines of above.  If you boil them down to what they are really doing without all the jargon - they are pretty simple concepts.  I'll cover them in future blog posts."
