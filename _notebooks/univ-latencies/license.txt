The dataset is this package corresponds to the retrieval latencies 
of more than 700 universities homepages. The pages have been probed 
every 10mins for more than one week in May 2004 from an internet 
connection located in New York, NY, USA.

The data is comma separated. The URLs are indicated in the first line.
The latencies value are expressed in millisecond. The data includes
760 URLs and 1361 latencies per URL.

The initial purpose of this dataset was to be used as a
benchmarking dataset for the multi-armed bandit problem.
This dataset is released under public domain license.
