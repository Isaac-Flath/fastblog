    "# What is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional analysis looks at historical data and describes it.  The data is fixed and you are looking to make a prediction based on the data.  The person is responsible for finding **and** understanding the interactions.  This gets exponentially more difficult in higher dimensional problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Partial Dependence Plotting looks at a prediction, and modifies the data to see how it effects the prediction.  The **model** is fixed and you are looking to understand interactions by modifying the data.  **The model is responsible for finding the interactions and the person just focuses on understanding the interactions the model found.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, you can think of Descriptive Analysis as a method of analysis that focuses on understanding the data, where Partial Dependence Plotting is a method of analysis that focuses on understanding the predictions.  They can accomplish similar goals but approach it differently.\n"

    "# Why use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the **biggest challenges of statistics is that is requires a person to make a series of assumptions**.  Whether you are doing p-values, or correlations, or any other test you are typically making some assumption.  Maybe you have to assume the data follows a particular distribution, maybe you have to assume that your variables are independent, or maybe you assume your variables and linearly dependent.  Whatever the case may be, you typically have to make some assumption - and if you make the wrong assumptions you can get incorrect findings.  It's for this reason that P-Values are not recommended for use in validating results by the majority of the top statisticians (including the American Statistical Association), despite the fact that most business analysts use them heavily in their analysis and decision making.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This leads me to the first advantage of the partial dependence plotting approach, which is a big differentiator between statistics and data science.  **With partial dependence plotting you are testing through experimentation rather than through descriptive statistics and statistical testing**.  For example a Neural Network can approximate any function, whether that is linear, exponential, logistic, or any other shape with any number of interactions. So I can use that, measure the accuracy, and understand the uncertainty of my analysis with no assumptions about distribution, co-linearity, or type of function.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second advantage is that if you have sufficient data for your analysis, but it's not all the right type due to some data imbalance you can leverage all the data for the analysis.  For example, if you are looking at customer churn you likely have many more accounts that did not churn than accounts that did churn.  With descriptive statistics you will look at the few churned accounts and see what they have in common.  With a model driven approach, **you can look at accounts that did not churn and see what changes you could make to those accounts that makes them more likely to churn.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A third advantage is that the output you are seeing is the prediction.  **The prediction of the future is often what is of value**, so if the goal is to make some decision based on what is likely to happen in the future **keeping that in the forefront is ideal.**"
