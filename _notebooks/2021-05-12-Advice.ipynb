This approach will build a very strong practical foundation.\n",

I could then converse with others about art, different styles, how different artists use different brush strokes, and much more.  But that's not the same as being able to do art.  We all know that you can't actually get good at painting by reading books or watching lectures.  The same applies to every other topic such as deep learning, data science, or software engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "So spend most of your time doing whatever the lecture/tutorial discussed.  Apply whatever was in the lecture to a new dataset.  If the course implemented a loss function, implement a different loss function.  Do lots of related projects where you don't have a tutorial, course, or instructions for exactly what you are doing.  Try a different architecture.  Just experiment a lot and try as much stuff out as you can.  Tinker.  That is where you actually learn.  A lecture can make this step faster and easier, but does not replace it.\n",
