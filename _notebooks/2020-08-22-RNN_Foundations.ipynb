A piece of punctuation could be a token as it has meaning.  If a work is in all capital letters that could be a token.  A portion of a word could be a token (ie dis) because a word beginning with dis has meaning.  There are many many ways to tokenize, for this post I will use the most simple approach.  That is, I will split based on spaces to make each word a token."

What I mean by that, is we would loop through each of the 3 tokens, output our predictions for those, update the weights, then reset back for a new set.  This isn't really how language works.  Language has a pattern and a sequence to it.  The further back you go the less important, but even things said a couple minutes ago could be important.  Could you imagine holding a conversation if you could only remember and respond based on the last 3 words?\n",

We will only update the last batch of weights (as if we updated all of them by the 1000th one we would be updating far to many weights to compute).  We call this \"detaching\" it.  Ultimately we are left with the same thing, but if has a memory of previous sequences beyond the one we are processing!  Let's see if it makes things better."
