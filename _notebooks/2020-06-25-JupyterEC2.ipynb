If this is your first time using AWS, EC2, or you aren't already fairly familiar with the process then I recommend checking out a guide that explains things a bit more.  This is meant to be be a good place to use as a reminder of what to do while you do it the first 10 or 20 times, rather than a step-by-step guide on how to do it.\n",
