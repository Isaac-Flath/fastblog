    "# What is Attribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Attribution is all about attributing a cause to a result.  In this post I will discuss it at a high level in the context of seeking a conversion or sale.  So what does that mean and why does that matter exactly?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a company you have many different ways you can influence customers or potential customers.  A few examples:\n",
    "1. Phone Call\n",
    "1. Email with picture A\n",
    "1. Email with picture B\n",
    "1. Send a Coupon\n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine you just made a sale and you had sent a coupon, called, and sent an email to that customer in the last 6 months.  Which one was responsible for the sale?  Was it just one responsible, or was the combination of mediums important?  How do I know if the phone call was \"worth it\"?  What about the coupon?  Should I replicate this combination or are there better combinations?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answers to all of this require great data about what the causes are (action) that led to the effect (sale).  This is what attribution is all about.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wonder whether you should be using attribution in your efforts just ask yourself the following questions.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Do you want to know what activities you have done led to sales?  Do you want to know whether a campaign you launched was worth it?  Do you want to know what marketing you do is effective?\n",
    "\n",
    "If the answer is yes to either of those, you should get comfy with a few different attribution models.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Purpose of this post\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand the problem and it's importance, let me be specific about what I hope to accomplish in this post.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Primary Goal:** Communicate a high level understanding of several basic approach to attribution, how they work, what they are good at, what they are not so good at.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Secondary Goal:**  Expand on the questions in the \"What is Attribution?\" section and give some ideas for how this data can actually be used and why it is so powerful once you have it."

For example if you are selling cheap pens and pencils, a customer probably didn't start thinking about the purchase over the course of multiple interactions and work up to the decision to buy.  They probably simply knew they were going to need some soon or were running low, and they saw an ad at the right time with the right message and clicked to buy.  In that scenario, last-touch could be very appropriate.\n",

In our example, they only opened the email because they were thinking about the product.  They only got to the popup because they opened the email and clicked through.  In this type of scenario, it isn't accurate to say the final action gets all the credit.  In many luxury products, last-touch is not ideal.\n",

    "# Gotchas to consider\n",
    "\n",
    "In any attribution approach there are some things to consider.  The goal of this section isn't to scare you off, but just to ensure you realize that you can't just take one of these and implement it without further thought.  Each of these areas would require further research and thought as you seek to implement an attribution model in your organization.\n",
    "+ Just because you sent an email and the customer clicked through and bought doesn't mean they wouldn't have bought without that email.  Some of those customers would have bought anyway so really your marketing effort did nothing, but may still get credit for the sale.  This can skew your ROI calculations.\n",
    "+ You may not be able to track all touch points.  Any interaction the customer has you want to be able to track - so spend time thinking about what all the possible touch points are and how reliably you can track each of them.  There may be some you can't track - but you need to be aware of those and not just ignore them.\n",
    "+ Digital tracking to understand those touch points can be extremely difficult, especially as people have more and more devices they use (phone, tablet, work computer, personal computer, etc.).  People may look up a product on their computer, go visit a store, and then look up reviews on their phone before buying.  Tying all those together can be challenging, but helps to get the whole picture.\n",
    "+ Not all customers are equal.  Different customers respond to different channels in different ways.  Some customers are expensive to sell to others are relatively easy.  Segmenting revenue reports by channel and by other customer segments is important so that you have a plan for all your customers and not just planning for the average.\n",
    "+ For every *hypothesis* on how customers behave and how you should attribute, you should be trying to verify that as best you can with data.  Can you see any patterns in who buys and who does not that supports your theory?"

    "I hope you learned a bit about marketing attribution.  These are the basics and are a great starting point.  Proper attribution is important because once you can properly attribute the causes of sales you can calculate ROI.  When you can calculate ROI you can make data driven decisions about effectiveness of experiments campaigns and initiatives.  The better you can measure success the faster you can experiment with marketing initiatives and the more confident you can be in the results you are seeing.  Marketing is not a discipline where anyone has the \"right\" answer and can jump in and have every campaign land perfectly.  It's all about setting things up so as you try things you learn as much as possible from what worked and what didn't so your next marketing effort is more informed and has an increased chance of success.\n",

    "Two other critical things I hope you got from this:\n",
    "+ The core concepts are something that anyone can understand, even if you don't understand any of the code.\n",
    "+ Why you would use one attribution methodology vs another is as much a business question as it is a technical question, so these decisions should be made through collaboration of the 2 teams."
