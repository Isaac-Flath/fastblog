In order to work toward those goals, I am revisiting the Math behind Neural Networks.  This time my goal is to understand intuitively every piece of the material forward and backward - rather than to pass a course on a deadline.\n",

In the first Lecture it was about understanding how to solve them intuitively with linear combinations and matrix multiplication.  In reality, that is not a scalable choice when you get to higher and higher dimensions.  We need to be able to express these concepts in matrices and be more comfortable with that language and operations.."

Either the right side is also 0 and it gives you no information, or the right side is not 0 and there is no solution (ie 2 = 0 is False).\n",
