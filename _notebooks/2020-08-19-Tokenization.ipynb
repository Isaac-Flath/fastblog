    "In this post we are going to dive into NLP, specifically Tokenization.  Tokenization are the foundation of all NLP. \n",
    "\n",
    "So what is a language model?  In short, it is a model that uses the preceding words to predict the next word.  We do not need seperate labels, because they are in the text.  This is training the model on the nuances of the language you will be working on.  If you want to know if a tweet is toxic or not, you will need to be able to read and understand the tweet in order to do that.  The language model helps with understanding the tweet - then you can use that model with those weights to tune it for the final task (determining whether the tweet is toxic or not).\n",
