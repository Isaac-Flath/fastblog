    "I made a very minimal version of nbdev with the intent toward use in one-off projects rather than full featured library. I released to pip for my own use, though I'd take it down if it's something that fits within NBdev.\n",
    "\n",
    "I often find myself wishing I could always use the `#export` tags when coding in notebooks and have any code cells that start with `#export` just auto-magically be in .py modules.  It's a pain to copy code between multiple notebooks, but it's also a pain to copy and paste code between modules and notebooks.\n",

    "[NBDev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) offers an innovative solution and this small library was inspired by it.  If you aren't familiar with NBDev, [check it out](https://nbdev.fast.ai/).  NBdev comes out of the box with lots of powerful features such as:\n",
    "+ Automated Testing and CI\n",
    "+ Automated creation and deployment of documentation site\n",
    "+ Automated releases to both conda and pip\n",
    "+ Too many more to name\n",
    "\n",
    "So why just use NBDev if it's so awesome?  Well sometimes I don't need all those powerful features listed above. Separate documentation, release to conda and pip, and automated CI means there's configuration that needs to be filled out.  If I am just fiddling with something or working on a one-off project I don't need a documentation page for that and I am not making something that will ever be released to pip or conda.  So that means I don't need the configuration items and can make something simpler.\n",
