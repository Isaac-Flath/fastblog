    "**Background:**  Multi Armed Bandits (MAB) are a method of choosing the best action from a bunch of options.  In order to choose the best action there are several problems to solve.  These are:\n",
    "1. How do you know what action is \"best\"?\n",
    "2. What if the \"best\" action changes over time?  How do you know it's changed?\n",
    "3. How do I balance choosing the best action with collecting new information?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**  The purpose of this post is to explain what a Multi Armed Bandit (MAB) is, and how it solves those problems."

    "# MAB Setup Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "In it's essence, MAB is just A/B testing in an intelligent and automated way.  Because it is like A/B testing it has very similar requirements for setup, but because it is automated it often requires defining these items with a bit more precision.  Let's start with what we need to have before we can use a MAB.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Things to Define** The things needed to set up new actions are the same as needed to set up an A/B test:\n",
    "1. What the action is (ie send an email)\n",
    "1. When selected, what should be done (ie use x template to send automated email to y customer)\n",
    "1. What is the success criteria\n",
    "1. What is the metric\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the above is business information that business stakeholders decide in conjunction with technical teams.  The tricky piece is **all metrics must be comparable to each other**.  This is easy if it's all emails and you just want to measure click through rate, but sometimes comparisons are harder.  A common approach is to **define each of these in terms of dollars** (if possible).\n",
    "\n",
    ">Example: Which is better: A 10% click through email rate, or 2% phone answering rate?  Without defining it in terms of dollars (profit or revenue), how do you know which is better for the business?"

I hope in addition to that you understand what are some of the challenges to a succesful implementation and full solution.  I did not code up the variations that make this approach more powerful, but with this as a foundation and a little research you now should have all the tools you need to get started."
